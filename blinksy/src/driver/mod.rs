//! # Driver Interface
//!
//! A driver is what tells the LED hardware how to be the colors you want.
//!
//! ## Core traits
//!
//! - [`Driver`]: For all blocking drivers
//! - [`DriverAsync`]: For all async drivers
//!
//! ## Re-usable implementations
//!
//! - [`clocked`]: For clocked (two-wire) protocols (like [`APA102`](crate::drivers::apa102))
//! - [`clockless`]: For clockless (one-wire) protocols (like [`WS2812`](crate::drivers::ws2812))

/// Core trait for all blocking LED drivers.
///
/// This trait defines the common interface for sending color data to LED hardware,
/// regardless of the specific protocol or chipset being used.
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// * `Error` - The error type that may be returned by the driver
/// * `Color` - The color type accepted by the driver
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// # use blinksy::{color::{ColorCorrection, FromColor, LinearSrgb}, driver::Driver};
///
/// struct MyDriver {
///     // Implementation details
/// }
///
/// impl Driver for MyDriver {
///     type Error = ();
///     type Color = LinearSrgb;
///
///     fn write<I, C>(&mut self, pixels: I, brightness: f32, correction: ColorCorrection) -> Result<(), Self::Error>
///     where
///         I: IntoIterator<Item = C>,
///         Self::Color: FromColor<C>,
///     {
///         // Implementation of writing colors to the LED hardware

    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `pixels` - Iterator over colors

    /// * `correction` - Color correction factors

/// # Type Parameters
