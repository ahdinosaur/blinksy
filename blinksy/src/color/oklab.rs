/// # Oklab Color Space
///
/// Oklab is a perceptual color space designed for improved uniformity and
/// blending characteristics compared to traditional spaces like sRGB or
/// CIELAB. Its goal is to make mathematical color operations align more
/// closely with how humans perceive color differences.
///
/// It represents colors using three components:
///
/// - `l`: **Perceptual Lightness**. This value typically ranges from 0.0 (black)
///   to 1.0 (white). Changes in `l` are intended to correspond linearly
///   with perceived changes in brightness.
/// - `a`: Represents the green-red axis. Negative values lean towards green,
///   and positive values lean towards red. A value near zero is neutral grey
///   along this axis.
/// - `b`: Represents the blue-yellow axis. Negative values lean towards blue,
///   and positive values lean towards yellow. A value near zero is neutral grey
///   along this axis.
///
/// ## Properties
///
/// - **White Point**: D65 (6500K), same as sRGB
///
/// Oklab, like many standard color spaces, is based on the D65 whitepoint,
/// which represents average daylight.
///
/// ## Why Use Oklab?
///
/// The primary advantage of Oklab is its **perceptual uniformity**. This means
/// that a small change in the Oklab coordinates (i.e., a small Euclidean
/// distance in the 3D Oklab space) corresponds more closely to a small,
/// equally perceived difference in color by a human observer, regardless
/// of the color's initial hue, lightness, or chroma.
///
/// This property makes Oklab excellent for:
///
/// - **Color Gradients and Interpolation:** Blending colors in Oklab
///   often results in smoother, more natural-looking transitions without
///   undesirable "greyish" or "muddy" intermediate colors sometimes seen
///   when blending in sRGB.
/// - **Image Processing:** Operations like desaturation, adjusting
///   lightness, or manipulating contrast can be performed in Oklab with
///   less risk of affecting the perceived hue or introducing artifacts.
///   For example, simply setting `a` and `b` to zero effectively grayscales
///   a color while preserving its *perceived* lightness.
/// - **Color Picking Interfaces:** Providing a more intuitive way for users
///   to select and manipulate colors based on how they are seen.
///
